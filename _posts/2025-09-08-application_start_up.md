## Yo, where we at
### Modus operandi
With our first priority (database setup) mostly worked out, we can now get started on preparing a face to show the world.  
Since the database is in place, other members can now start storing whatever data they need in the format they want.  
Database schema to be done later, placeholders can be used as inspiration or changed to suit our needs if they come close.

## The three parter
### ~~Java~~TypeScript
The bread and butter. It's a sidekick to JavaScript, that introduces types to JavaScript, making it easier to catch errors early and maintain larger projects.  
Even if our project stays small, I like the clarity of types. It’s easier to read, reason about, and avoid silly mistakes.  

### React
React handles our UI components. It’s a very popular framework with a lot of community support, and it’s flexible enough to be used for both web and mobile applications.  
The idea of splitting UI into components feels familiar thanks to our earlier work with Blazor, so the transition doesn’t feel like starting from scratch.  
Because React is as common as it is, there's a lot of material available for learning. This means I can expect to not be stuck on a problem for long.  

#### Alternatives
These are on the same level as React, and might be considered or experimented with at a later date.  
- **Angular**: Framework, great if you want structure, but heavier to learn.  
- **Vue**: Lightweight and beginner-friendly, but still powerful enough for complex apps.  

### Node.js
This is a consideration if we want a backend to the website itself. We are, however, more on the idea of an API gateway, so this might not see the light of day. Separation of Concerns and all that.  
With that said, it's not unlikely that this will still be a necessary component, as there might be things outside of the gateway's scope that needs to be handled.  
Things like authentication, authorization, logging, or rate limiting might be handled by the website, rather than being forced through the API gateway.

## Possible avenues
Here's some words I've heard, but need to put aside for later:  
- **Framework add-ons:** Next.js (routing, SSR/SEO)
- **Tooling:** Vite (fast builds), ESLint/Prettier (consistency)
- **Styling:** Tailwind (utility-first CSS)
- **State management:** Redux Toolkit, Zustand

## IDE? No idea...
Holy heck this was a can of worms to get into. Everyone swears by their own "IDE", and everyone has their own reasons. Hell, some of them are not IDEs, but editors! And what the heck is the difference there?!  
After looking left and right, Visual Studio Code was the most obvious choice. But I am lazy when I'm comfortable, and I'm comfortable with Visual Studio (2022), and since I can't see a good reason to get out of this particular IDE, that's where I'll stay.  
Here's a list of other potential candidates that I considered, in case I change my mind later:  
- Visual Studio Code (free, extensible, popular) (Editor) (Far most likely alternative)
- Notepad++ (Windows-only, but lightweight) (Editor)
- Vim/Neovim (for the hardcore, but steep learning curve) (Linux??)
- JetBrains WebStorm (paid, but powerful)
- IntelliJ IDEA (paid, but great for full-stack)

## One step at a time
As it stands, everything is still way too new to consider a solid choice. But there's a plan, of sorts, and that can be followed until I learn the holes that might be in my way.  
Experiments are still to be had, and the connections between the group members' parts are still up in the air.
