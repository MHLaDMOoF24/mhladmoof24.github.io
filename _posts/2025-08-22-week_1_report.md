## Feed Back - Reflections
#### Website Portfolio
Choices were made... GitHub IO with a custom setup, instead of a WordPress-like solution. 
This has meant that I have had to learn more HTML and CSS, but also how to implement Jekyll. 
One major consideration has been time investment. 
In general, these FBFUFF reports will become the basis for the upcoming exam, and thus need to have a good, non-obstructive way for me to post them. WordPress-ish solutions would likely simplify this a lot, but I feel that most of the work to set it up for GitHub has now been done. 
Tags help a lot, but a better general overview would likely be preferable secondary option.
Also my visuals are clunky :)

#### Project Design
A lot of the initial considerations have been worked out. 
The project now has a name, Mane Manager! A logo was also created. 
Early design is done, in the form of a domain diagram, a BPMN, and a very high-level activity diagram.

#### Database
I know of Redis from my involvement with Momentum Mod.
I have yet to properly research different types, but between my contacts and Anders saying NoSQL might be his preferance, this could be the obvious route to take. 
A cloud hosting service is already set up, but I don't have the knowhow to implement it yet. 

#### Application Design
As mentioned in Project Design above, the initial design is done.
A website app has been chosen to remove overhead of learning a new platform. Phone app can be implemented as a stretch goal.

## Feed Up - Goals
Broad, but shallow, knowledge of different database types to best choose a suitable one for the project.
A deeper (definition unknown) understanding of the chosen database type. 
A better understanding of how to implement a website app.

---

## Feed Forward - Next Steps
Continue to develop this portfolio website. It's still an obstacle to publishing these reports, but we're getting there.
This also doubles as a learning experience, to get more comfortable with the web as a platform.
Research Redis, a NoSQL database. 
Continue to coordinate with group, until we have a reasonable set of expectations for the project.
