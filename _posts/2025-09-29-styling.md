## A shift in focus
### From components to CSS
Up until now, everything has been about understanding React and TypeScript.  
This time, the learning goal was different: **get comfortable with CSS**, in a structured and scalable way.

This stylesheet became my first real exercise in organizing design systems, responsive layout techniques, and general frontend styling principles.

## What I learned
### CSS variables are a game changer
One of the biggest takeaways was finally leaning into `:root` variables.  
Colour palettes, borders, and fonts all live in one place, which makes the whole file easier to adjust.  

I’ve used CSS before, but not with this level of global configuration.  
The key learning: **variables make design consistent** and drastically cut down on repeated values.
This also makes changing the feel of the page incredibly simple!

### Responsive design with modern units
I ended up using `clamp()`, `min()`, and viewport-based units far more than expected.  
This taught me how to:
- Scale text without letting it get unreadably small  
- Maintain proportions across wildly different screen sizes  
- Avoid the classic “looks fine on my monitor” trap  

Also, realizing just how often flexbox solves layout problems before more complicated solutions are needed.

### Component-like thinking in CSS
The navbar, split layout, and card elements all follow the same pattern:
- Define the container  
- Predict how it changes with different space  
- Make typography scale intelligently  
- Keep behaviour predictable  

This was a useful mindset shift — treating CSS structures more like “visual components” rather than scattered style rules.

### Images and object-fit
I also learned how valuable `object-fit: cover` is for full-width or banner-style images.  
It keeps the image visually appealing without breaking layout.

## Wrapping up
The takeaway from this was the **styling fundamentals**: variables, responsive units, flexible layouts, and structured CSS.  

Now that these tools feel more familiar, moving forward with new components or pages should be much smoother.

Next topic awaits.
